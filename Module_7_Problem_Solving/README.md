Problem Definition: What is the problem you are looking to solve?

-Immigrants who need help finding resources on legal advice 

Customer Segments: Who experiences this problem and is likely to use your solution (Who is this for?)?

-Any person who has immigrated from another country, more specifically to the United States.

Solution: What is our MVP solution to this problem?

-Creating a web app that allows people to easily access and search resources, and filter based on the problems they are having.

Key Metrics: How will we know if our solution is effective?

-Possibly have a social platform, and anyone who shares the social platform, or comments may signify that this resource is being used. Another option could also be an anonymous survey to be filled if the user used or went to one of the resources.

Unique Value Proposition: What makes our solution different from other solutions solving the same problem?

-Unline google, here on the web app, all the resources will be all on one place, and no need to deep dive in google searches. This web app will serve for that one purpose, whereas google can be used to search for an infinite amount of things.

Revenue Structure: How will your solution make revenue so it is able to fund itself and consistently provide the service?

-We can reach out to investors, and companies that want to support the web app, as well as the people who are using the app.

Channels: How will we get our solution into the hands of those that can use it? Will it be downloaded/is it free? Will you need to train people on how to use it? Etc.

-It will be free and on the web, mobile friendly.

Unfair Advantage: Is there a factor that makes your solution more effective than other solutions by the nature of a structural advantage either of the product or of your team (for example, do you have access to data that others donâ€™t?)?

-We can possibly reach out to companies that possibly aren't google-ble, and or aren't so much on the web. Or smaller businesses that are just starting. 

Cost structure: What is the base cost it takes to create and maintain your solution? What is the cost of serving one person? The 100th person? The 1000th person?

-This may vary depending on the database, but starting out, it can possibly be free.
